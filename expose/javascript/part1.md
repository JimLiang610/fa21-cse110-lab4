Q4. Code returns an error because line 13 is trying to access the result vairable in a different block of code. This results in an eerror because result was declared with let meaning that it can't be accessed outside of the block it was declared, which is what line 13 attempts to do. 
Q5. The code returns an error. We changed the variable result to a const variable type, which prevents result from being reassigned after it's intialization. Since we attempt to reassigned result, the code throws an error. 
Q6. The code returns and error because earlier on in the code on line 7, we are trying to reassign a value to a const variable which is an invalid operation.
